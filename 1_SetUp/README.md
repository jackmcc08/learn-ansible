# LESSON 1 - Set Up to run ansible

These sections are to set up your control node and build some test VMs in Azure to practice on. 

Lessons: 
- 1.1 [Configure Control Host](./1.1_Configure_Control_Host/)  
- 1.2 [Configure Target Hosts](./1.2_Configure_Target_Hosts/)
- 1.3 [Create Target Hosts - Azure VM]()
- 1.4 [Destroy Target Hosts - Azure VM]()

If you already have Target VMs then you can just follow lessons `1.1` and `1.2`. If you need to create target hosts then also complete `1.3` and `1.4`. *Note the guide to create Azure VMs is using Ansible and so required you to have completed lesson `1.1`*

> NOTE: Delete any Cloud VM you create for the tutorial to avoid paying any additional costs.
