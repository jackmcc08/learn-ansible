# LESSON 1 - Set Up to run ansible

These sections are to set up your control node and build some test VMs in Azure to practice on. 

Lessons: 
- 1.1 [Configure Control Host](./1.1_Configure_Control_Host/)  
- 1.2 [Create Target Hosts - Azure VM](./1.2_Build_Azure_VM/)
- 1.3 [Configure Target Hosts](./1.3_Configure_Target_Hosts/)
- 1.4 [Destroy Target Hosts - Azure VM](1.4_Remove_Azure_VM/)

If you already have Target VMs then you can just follow lessons `1.1` and `1.3`. 

If you need to create target hosts then also complete `1.2` and `1.4`. *Note the guide to create Azure VMs is using Ansible and so its required to have completed lesson `1.1`*

> NOTE: Delete any Cloud VM you create for the tutorial to avoid paying any additional costs.
